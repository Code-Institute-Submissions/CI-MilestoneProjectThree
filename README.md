The inspiration behind this web application, **Foodology**, was to create a go-to place for *foodies* and other like-minded people to explore the vast cultural differences 
across the culinary world, and share recipe ideas and find new favourite meals - That's the big picture.

We also want to encourage friends and family to share their passion with each other and do so through the medium of cooking, and that can also be acheived here.

Food is a a subject that can connect strangers from all corners of the planet, and at Foodology, we wanted to create a fun and simple to use application to visitors to
view all recipes that have been created and shared by the wonderful food community, as well as allow these guests to create an account and share their own experiences.

* Fed up of the same evening meal routine? No problem.
* Want to prepare a special meal for loved ones? Look no further.
* Struggling for ideas for this week's shopping trip? We've got you covered.

We want our brand to spread far and wide and to encourage the world to give thier taste buds the love that they deserve.
