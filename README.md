1. [Overview](#overview)
The inspiration behind this web application, **Foodology**, was to create a go-to place for *foodies* and other like-minded people to explore the vast cultural differences 
across the culinary world, and share recipe ideas and find new favourite meals - That's the big picture.

We also want to encourage friends and family to share their passion with each other and do so through the medium of cooking, and that can also be acheived here.

Food is a a subject that can connect strangers from all corners of the planet, and at Foodology, we wanted to create a fun and simple to use application to visitors to
view all recipes that have been created and shared by the wonderful food community, as well as allow these guests to create an account and share their own experiences.

* Fed up of the same evening meal routine? No problem.
* Want to prepare a special meal for loved ones? Look no further.
* Struggling for ideas for this week's shopping trip? We've got you covered.

We want our brand to spread far and wide and to encourage the world to give thier taste buds the love that they deserve.

### Strategy
The key design principle of this site, is to have minimal text (excluding recipe details), and be very visual. 
Visitors have come to search for recipe ideas, or find inspiration and don't want to be distracted by large bodies of text.
Therefore we want to keep the application as sleek as possible and only display information that is applicable to the recipes as user is looking at.
The application therefore needs to be very intuitive, and have simple to use navigation for the guests/users to be able to search for others' recipes or add, edit and delete their own recipes  

### Scope
The scope is to cater for a variety of vistors wanting to find and add a wide variety of recipes.
We therefore want to cater for this audience by allowing users to.
* Create an account and log in.
* Add recipes
    - The type of meal a user is adding.
    - The complexity of the recipe being cooked. 
    - How long it will take to prepare and cook the meal.
    - Add an image of the end product.
    - Add the ingredients required to prepare the recipe.
    - Add instructions on how to cook the recipe.
* View your own recipes.
* Edit or delete your own recipes.
* View other recipes, or search on a particular criteria.

### Structure
It was decided that the Flask framework could be adopted for this application.

This enables the use of template inheritance, and routing, to create an efficient and interactive application with a consistent look and feel throughout.

This allows for multiple blocks of content to be built and maintained, and ultimately utilised dependant on the users interaction with the application.

As defined the scope, we can create block content for:

* Application home/ landing
* Registration 
* Login
* Creating new recipes
* Updating or deleting existing recipes
* Viewing recipes
* Searching for recipes
